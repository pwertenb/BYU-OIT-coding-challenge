<h1>Roman Numeral Calculator</h1>

This Python script can convert between Romam numerals and base 10 numbers.

<h2>Installation</h2>

It is expected that Python is installed on the system.

<h2>Usage</h2>
To convert a Roman numeral to decimal, use the argument 'rtod' then pass the numeral to convert. The numeral is NOT case sensitive.

    python3 main.py rtod LXIX

To convert a decimal to Roman numeral, use the argument 'dtor' then pass the number to convert. 

    python3 main.py dtor 69

The examples given in the code challenge PDF can be tested manually to check for correctness. To do so, uncomment the following functions:

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        #test_roman_to_decimal()
        #test_decimal_to_roman()

And comment out the main loop:

        main()

Other tests can be inserted into the tests and answers arrays if desired.

<h2>Notes</h2>

Some handwritten walkthroughs of code are included as a .jpg, but these are limited because I accidentally erased other notes as I was going.

The coding aspect of this project took me 3 hours. Testing on Windows, adding documentation and notes, and other rearranging added about 30 minutes to the total time.
